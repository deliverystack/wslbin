# playmed.bash.md: WSL Bash Shell Script for Image/Video/Audio Slideshow

Clippy 2.0 I and I wrote a Bash shell script to render a slideshow from the images and videos under a directory. I havenâ€™t tested everything, but supposedly it can:

- Recurse a directory tree to include images and videos.
- Sort by name or date in forward or reverse order, or randomize 
- Play .flac and/or .mp3 in the background with the option to pause during video.
- Render animated gifs.
-Display file names during the show.

Probably more; I forget. Completely untested.
